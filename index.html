                        It was a family day, a thing that we occasionally do. 
                        While we were at the many places that we went to, I asked my father to take this picture
                        and he took it with the biggest smile on his face. It was a nice feeling.

                    <p>The day of the graduation pictorial. Closer and closer to getting that diploma.
                        When it started to hit me that I'm finally getting out of high school, 
                        a weird and bittersweet feeling.

                        A day where we wear our best outfits, in my case it was this beautiful Violet dress. 
                        Nothing beats the feeling of being covered in your favorite color.
